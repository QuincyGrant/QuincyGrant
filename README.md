Hi, My name is Quincy! I am a fairly recent university graduate with a bachelor's degree in economics, and statistics,
so I am relatively new to the data world. With there being so much to learn, this page will consist of personal 
projects that test my knowledge, and track my development as a data professional. 


I hope that you might learn something from being here. Thank you for visiting!
