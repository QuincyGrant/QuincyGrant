Hi, My name is Quincy! I am a fairly recent university graduate with a bachelor's degree in economics, and statistics,
so I am relatively new to the data world. With there being such an incredible amount of things to learn, this repository 
will consist of personal projects that test my knowledge, and track my development as a data professional.


I hope that someday you'll learn something from being here. Thank you for visiting!
